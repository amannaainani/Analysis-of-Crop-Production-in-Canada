IBM SQL for Data Science with R (Final Project -completed by Amanna Ainani)
The purpose of this project is to analyse and better understand the performance of certain crop types 
in terms of supply and price (US Dollar and Canadian Dollar) at different province and times.
There are 4 datasets altogether used in this project which are two datasets from Statistics Canada and two datasets from a third datsource from Bank of Canada: 
1) Canadian Principal Crops Data , 2) Farm product prices ,3) Bank of Canada daily average exchange rates
These datasets are loaded into 4 seperate tables in a Db2 database. SQL queries are later executed using RODBC R package to complete all the problems
that have been tasked on this assignment.
